# AGS-Ka -- AGS' Life-Easer

---

This is a (so far) unofficial project that I'm doing for the AGS poli-sim discord server. I plan on AGS-Ka having the following features:

- [ ] Ability to retrieve all federal and state bills using slash commands
- [ ] Generate maps of areas of each party's control, and who occupies each seat
- [ ] Catalog and enumerate endorsements and campaign amounts for election tracking

This is an **unofficial** project! The mods have nothing to do with it so far, and they have no plans to integrate the bot into the server.

*By the way, the name is meant to be pronounced like* "Agnieszka"*, in Polish*
